# JL-Site
Personal website portfolio *work in progress*
Version 0.1.4

Update: I needed to reformat my devices and clone my repo to continue work on this afterward.

The following pages aren't linked/published due to ongoing work:
Projects - More in-depth projects page with examples of former/less impressive work.
Contact - Redundant contact information page for those who don't check the page footer? (possibly unnecessary)
Blog - Random articles/rants from my experience, could be helpful to show growth and expertise with my current role.
